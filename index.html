				<h3>Information about your <a href="#">Rental Purchase Agreement</a></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This is a rental purchase agreement ("Agreement") with Kafene, Inc. ("Kafene") or its subsidiary. This is not a loan or credit transaction.
					</li>

					</li>
					<li>
						Regular periodic payments will be automatically withdrawn from your bank account, charged to your card, or made at another authorized vendor or payment processor, depending upon information you provided us throughout the lease origination process.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may terminate the Agreement at any time, without penalty, and stop unaccrued regular periodic payments by returning the property to Kafene and paying any past due regular periodic payments. You will not receive a refund of any regular periodic payments accrued and paid to Kafene while in possession of the property.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Agreement includes reinstatement rights that may allow you to get returned property hack, as described the agreement
					</li>
